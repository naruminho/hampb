# Hydrologycal Alert Model with Participatory Basis (HAMPB)

GIT of the HAMPB model under development.

The content is divided in three folders: 
A folder named “src” with the source code of the SWMM assessment tool and the calibrated model of the basin; A folder named “data” with spreadsheets containing the observed data used for the calibration of the model, and a folder named “sheets” which contains four spreadsheet files. 
(i) the first spreadsheet was used to perform the data assimilation using the delta method. (ii) a spreadsheet used to perform the sensitivity analysis using MCM (Monte Carlo Method) for each sample; (iii) a spreadsheet with correlations used for the regionalization and used to create the synthetic VGI dataset; (iv) and finally, a spreadsheet applying the correlations in the POI.
